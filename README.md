# Flight_Controller_V1

This repo is dedicated to V1 of the flight controller code. While this is not technically my first attempt at a flight controller code, this is the first that is functional. Currently this controller is designed for a quadcopter but will be ported to a plane style controller eventually.

This was written in VSCode with PlatformIO.

## Hardware
* Arduino Nano knockoff
* MPU6050 IMU
* Buzzer module
